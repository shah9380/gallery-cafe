# The Gallery Cafe

Welcome to the repository for The Gallery Cafe's website task. This project is designed to practice various HTML tags and elements. Let's break down the different sections of the webpage and see which HTML tags were used.

## Screenshots and Explanations

### About Us Section

In this section, we have used heading tags `<h2>` for "About Us" and `<p>` tag for the Lorem ipsum text. Here's how it looks:

### Rate Us and Follow Us Section

This part contains anchor tags `<a>` for "Rate Us" and "Follow us". These create hyperlinks to external pages. Here's a screenshot:

### Menu Section

In the menu section, we've utilized various tags. For the headings, we used `<h2>` tags. The lists are created using `<ol>` (ordered lists) and `<li>` (list items) tags. Here's how it looks:

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shah9380/gallery-cafe.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the webpage.

## Learning

Through this task, I've gained practical experience with opening and closing tags, nesting elements, using basic tags like `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`, and created different sections of a webpage.
